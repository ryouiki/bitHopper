# Instructions

In order to run bithopper you need twisted phython and pyopenssl installed with Python 2.7 (recommended):

http://python.org/download/
https://launchpad.net/pyopenssl/+download
http://pypi.python.org/pypi/zope.interface (for Windows)
http://twistedmatrix.com/trac

Copy "user.cfg.default" to a new file called "user.cfg" then modify the new
file to include your pool worker usernames and passwords, instead of mine.
Run "python bitHopper.py". After script updates info, please check if new pools
have been added correctly if not edit your "user.cfg" accordingly.

If you don't want to use a pool give it an invalid password (WARNING: some pools
ignore passwords from miners!), or go to http://localhost:8337/stats and switch its
role to disable, or just delete it from "user.cfg".

BitHopper listens on loopback interface so you should direct your miner to
localhost:8337 with any username and password (not blank).

BitHopper status page: http://localhost:8337/stats

# Windows installation

Download and install:

https://launchpad.net/pyopenssl
http://pypi.python.org/pypi/zope.interface
http://twistedmatrix.com/trac

Then follow the above instructions

# Switches

You can launch bH with the following parameters:

	--list            = List servers
	--disable         = Servers to disable. Get name from --list. Servera,Serverb,Serverc
	--port            = Port to listen on
	--scheduler       = Select an alternate scheduler
	--listschedulers  = List alternate schedulers available
	--threshold       = Override difficulty threshold (default 0.43)
	--altslicesize    = Override Default AltSliceScheduler Slice Size of 900
	--altminslicesize = Override Default Minimum Pool Slice Size of 60 (AltSliceScheduler only)
	--altslicejitter  = Add some random variance to slice size, disabled by default (AltSliceScheduler only)
	--startLP         = Seeds the LP module with known pools.
	--noLP            = Turns off client side longpolling
	--debug           = Use twisted output
	--p2pLP           = Starts up an IRC bot to validate LP based hopping
	--ip              = IP to listen on
	--auth            = Ask for user and password on stats page (--auth user,pass)


# Available Schedulers:

   OldDefaultScheduler

A none slicing scheduler. May actually be the best scheduler there is.

   DefaultScheduler

The time based default scheduler. All that matters is time and it tries to be completely fair across all pools. A little less effective but thoroughly debugged.

   AltSliceScheduler

Tries to be more aggressive at switching pools when thresholds are met rather than finishing a slice. Can be used with --altslicesize=xxx --altminslicesize=xxx (where you replace x with a number for slice size and min). Also slice size can be used with --altslicejitter=xx which adds some random variance to slice size. There can be issues with failing to re-slice often enough.

   RoundTimeScheduler

Not currently in use.

   RoundTimeDynamicPenaltyScheduler

Not currently in use.


# Skins

You can change the color scheme on the status page. Skins and .jpg preview are located in the StatSkin sub directory.
Just copy the index file to the main directory to change skin and hit refresh on your browser. No need to restart.
